Bisouland is a free online strategy-game. In order to play you only need a
web browser.

Take your opponents love points by sending them kisses!

## Installation

 1. Create the file `web/news/.htpasswd`;
 2. configure the database in [web/phpincludes/bd.php](web/phpincludes/bd.php);
 3. check email sending for registration;
 4. put the admin email in the variable `$destinataire`
 	from [web/news/mail.php](web/news/mail.php).

## Structure

A Symfony2 application will be the entry point of every requests. If the route
is not found, the legacy application will be boostraped.

**Warning**: this legacy application lies in the `web` directory
and has been created in 2005 while learning web development,
which means that tt probably contains security holes, bugs, low quality code
and bad design pattern.
