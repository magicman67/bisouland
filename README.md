# Bisouland

Bisouland is a free online strategy-game. In order to play you only need a
web browser.

Take your opponents love points by sending them kisses!

## Installation

1. Create the file `web/news/.htpasswd`;
2. configure the database in [web/phpincludes/bd.php](web/phpincludes/bd.php);
3. check email sending for registration;
4. put the admin email in the variable `$destinataire`
   from [web/news/mail.php](web/news/mail.php).

## Structure

Every request will go to the Symfony2 application. If the route is not found
in it, the legacy application will be boostraped.

**Warning**: the legacy application, which lies in the `web` directory,
has been created in 2005 by a someone who was learning web development.
Therefore it probably contains security holes, bugs, low quality code
and bad design pattern.
